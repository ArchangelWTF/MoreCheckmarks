# needMoreColor is a light red by default, appears when you still need more of that item
# fulfilledColor is a light green by default, appears when you fulfilled the requirements of all modules
# that require it depending on fulfilledAnyCanBeUpgraded setting
# wishlistColor is a light blue by default, appears when the item is in wishlist
# Please keep the format (value,value,value) (note the lack of spaces) since that is the one that the values will be parsed in
# Otherwise the settings won't work
# The values should always be in RGB in range [0 - 1]
